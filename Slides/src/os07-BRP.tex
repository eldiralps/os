\frametitle{Week 07 Synchronization \& Deadlock:
Learning Outcomes\footnote{Source: ACM IEEE CS Curricula 2013}}
\begin{itemize}
\item Use mutual exclusion to avoid a given race condition. [Usage]
\item Give an example of an ordering of accesses among concurrent activities (e.g., program with a data race) that is not sequentially consistent. [Familiarity]
\item Use semaphores to block threads [Usage]
\end{itemize}
