Learning Outcomes\footnote{Source: ACM IEEE CS Curricula 2013}}

\begin{itemize}
\item Explain the key difference between serial and parallel devices and identify the conditions in which each is appropriate. [Familiarity]
\item Identify the relationship between the physical hardware and the virtual devices maintained by the operating system. [Usage]
\item Explain buffering and describe strategies for implementing it. [Familiarity]
\item Differentiate the mechanisms used in interfacing a range of devices (including hand-held devices, networks, multimedia) to a computer and explain the implications of these for the design of an operating system. [Usage]
\item Describe the advantages and disadvantages of direct memory access and discuss the circumstances in
which its use is warranted. [Usage]
\item Identify the requirements for failure recovery. [Familiarity]
\item Implement a simple device driver for a range of possible devices. [Usage]

\item I/O Programming [Usage]
\item Network Programming [Usage]
\end{itemize}
